# The Coq-Kruskal project by [D. Larchey-Wendling](https://members.loria.fr/DLarchey/files)

## The contents

List of sub-repositories:
- [`Kruskal-Trees`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Trees):
- [`Kruskal-Finite`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Finite):
- [`Kruskal-AlmostFull`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-AlmostFull):
- [`Kruskal-Higman`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Higman):
- [`Kruskal-Veldman`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Veldman):
- [`Kruskal-Theorems`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Kruskal-Theorems): and derives several instances of [Kruskal's tree theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem)

Side contributions and applications:
- the [`Karp-Miller`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Karp-Miller) algorithm for solving the [covering problem for Petri nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net), of which termination is established using almost full relation, in particular, Coquand's version of Ramsey's theorem.
- [`Friedman-TREE`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Friedman-TREE): the construction of [Harvey Friedman's weak `Tree(n)` and `TREE(n)` functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem) which are extremelly fast frowing functions that cannot be proved to exist in too weak m√πeta-theories, eg Peano arithmetic.
